**Privacy Policy**  

This Privacy Policy outlines the practices and principles we follow to ensure your data privacy and security when using our app.  

### **Data Collection**  
- **No Personal Data Collected**: This app is designed to function entirely offline and does not collect, process, or store any personal information from users.  
- **No Usage Tracking**: We do not track your activity, usage patterns, or preferences within the app.  

### **Data Sharing**  
- **No Data Sharing**: Since we do not collect or store any data, there is no information to share with third parties.  

### **Permissions**  
- **Minimal Permissions**: The app may request permissions essential for its functionality (e.g., storage access to save encoded messages, network status if applicable). These permissions are only used locally on your device and are not used to collect or transmit any data.  

### **Offline Functionality**  
- **Completely Offline**: This app operates entirely offline, meaning it does not require an internet connection to use its features. This ensures that all app activities remain private and confined to your device.  

### **Security**  
- **Device-Only Operations**: All data generated or accessed within the app is not stored even locally on your device and is not accessible by us or any third party.  

### **Changes to This Privacy Policy**  
- As this app does not collect or manage user data, there are no anticipated changes to this Privacy Policy. However, we reserve the right to update it if the appâ€™s features change in the future. Any updates will be clearly communicated within the app.
- Eg. In future if we come up with online learning data storage, in this case you'll be informed changes via in-app messaging.
